# YAM Project

YAM is a WordPress project consisting of a **custom theme** and **separate plugins**, developed to showcase modern WordPress development with React (Gutenberg), PHP, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

The design was initially **inspired by a template from TemplateMo**. The original design only provided static **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** files.  
I used the design as inspiration, but the entire project was **rebuilt from scratch** as a WordPress theme and plugin system, written in **PHP, React, and TailwindCSS**.

This transformation makes the site fully dynamic, allowing the admin to manage galleries, texts, and content directly from the WordPress dashboard.
