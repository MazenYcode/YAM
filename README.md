# YAM Project

YAM is a WordPress project consisting of a **custom theme** and **separate plugins**, developed to showcase modern WordPress development with React (Gutenberg), PHP, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

The design was initially **inspired by a template from TemplateMo**, but the entire codebase (theme and plugins) has been **rebuilt from scratch**, ensuring full flexibility and performance.
